# TrafficSigningSystem
This project consists of two scenarios concerning the traffic signing system. In the first case, the car is submitted to a speed limit road sign. However, the second case consists of 4 way-intersection allowing traffic from different directions to cross paths or change direction.
Note : 
This project is a part of a recent published paper (July 2024) entitled: FE4NorOMAS: A Distributed Fuzzy Enforcement Approach for Normative Open Multi-Agent Systems.
The findings of the paper are showcased through this project source code.
