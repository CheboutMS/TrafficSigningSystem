# TrafficSigningSystem
This project consist of two scenarios concerning the traffic signing system, In the first case, the car is submitted to a speed limit road sign,however, in the second case study consist of 4 way-intersection allowing traffic from different directions to cross paths or change direction.
Note : 
This project is a part of a recent publication paper entitled: FE4NorOMAS: A Distributed Fuzzy Enforcement Approach for Normative Open Multi-Agent Systems
the findings of the paper are showcased through this project source code.
